This is my hacky attempt to learn some node, backbone and mongo

The coreidea is:

* Render the world map (using Google Maps API)
* Allow writing short messages on the map
* Each message is bound to a specific location (latitude and longitude)
* Messages are posted anonymously
* Display messages when the map renders

Would be good to have:

* If two messages overlap at current zoom level, figure out which one to show based on some ranking system
* Use peerindex score + twitter sign in for ranking? (but still maintain anonymity)
* Vote message up/down functionality (only for signed in users)
* Make voting only available to signed in 
* Instead of fetching all messages at once, select based on zoom level, viewport bounds and ranking
